    # This is an automated artifact rejection function which ensures that 
    # the data contains no flat-lined channels.
    #
    # In:
    #   Signal : continuous data set, assumed to be appropriately high-passed (e.g. >0.5Hz or
    #            with a 0.5Hz - 2.0Hz transition band)
    #
    #   MaxFlatlineDuration : Maximum tolerated flatline duration. In seconds. If a channel has a longer
    #                         flatline than this, it will be considered abnormal. Default: 5
    #
    #   MaxAllowedJitter : Maximum tolerated jitter during flatlines. As a multiple of epsilon.
    #                      Default: 20
    #
    # Out:
    #   Signal : data set with flat channels removed
    #
    # Examples:
    #   % use with defaults
    #   eeg = clean_flatlines(eeg);
